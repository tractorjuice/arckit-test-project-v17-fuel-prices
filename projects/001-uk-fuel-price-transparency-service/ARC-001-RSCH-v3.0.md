## UK Government Compliance Checklist

| # | Compliance Criterion | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|---|---------------------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | UK data residency available (data at rest in UK) | PARTIAL | London region (eu-west-1) provides UK data at rest. However, management plane operations and metadata may traverse Alibaba's global infrastructure, which includes significant infrastructure in China. This raises data sovereignty concerns under UK Government policy. |
| 2 | ISO 27001 certified | PASS | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified. Certificate available from Alibaba Cloud Trust Center. |
| 3 | SOC 2 Type II report available | PASS | SOC 2 Type II reports issued twice yearly (1 Apr-31 Mar and 1 Oct-30 Sep). Available under NDA from Trust Center. |
| 4 | UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018 compliant | PARTIAL | Alibaba Cloud offers Data Processing Agreement (DPA) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). London region enables UK data residency. However, concerns exist about potential data access under China's National Intelligence Law (2017) which mandates cooperation with Chinese government intelligence requests. Legal opinion required on adequacy. |
| 5 | Cyber Essentials Plus certified | FAIL | No evidence of Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus certification. This is a mandatory requirement for UK Government suppliers handling personal data. AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all hold Cyber Essentials Plus. |
| 6 | NCSC Cloud Security Principles alignment | FAIL | No formal NCSC assessment of Alibaba Cloud has been published. AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all have published NCSC Cloud Security Principles assessments. Without this, information assurance sign-off for OFFICIAL workloads is extremely difficult to obtain. |
| 7 | G-Cloud listed on Digital Marketplace | FAIL | Alibaba Cloud is NOT listed as a direct supplier on the UK Government Digital Marketplace (G-Cloud 14 or 15). EY and some consultancies offer Alibaba Cloud services through G-Cloud, but not Alibaba Cloud directly. Without G-Cloud listing, procurement requires bespoke commercial process, significantly increasing cost and timeline. |
| 8 | GDS Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) aligned | PARTIAL | TCoP alignment is theoretically possible but untested. Point 3 (Be open and use open source) -- Alibaba Cloud supports some open-source tools. Point 7 (Use open standards) -- API Gateway supports OpenAPI. Point 9 (Create a secure service) -- compromised by lack of NCSC assessment. No precedent exists for GDS assessment of services hosted on Alibaba Cloud. |
| 9 | OFFICIAL classification workloads supported | FAIL | While Alibaba Cloud's London region technically provides infrastructure suitable for OFFICIAL workloads, the absence of NCSC assessment, Cyber Essentials, and G-Cloud listing means that the UK Government's standard assurance process for OFFICIAL workloads cannot be completed. The SIRO would be unable to sign off the risk without significant additional due diligence. |
| 10 | UK Government contract / support available | PARTIAL | Alibaba Cloud has a UK office (Alibaba Cloud (UK) Ltd, London). Enterprise support tier available (~GBP 12,000+/month). However, primary expertise is in Chinese/Asia-Pacific markets, UK-focused support staff are limited, and the UK partner ecosystem of Alibaba-experienced government integrators is negligible compared to AWS/Azure/GCP. |

**Overall Compliance Pass Rate**: 2 of 10 criteria pass (20%), 4 partial (40%), 4 fail (40%).

---

## Gaps and Risks

| # | Gap / Risk | Severity | Affected Requirement(s) | Mitigation |
|---|-----------|----------|------------------------|------------|
| 1 | **No G-Cloud listing** -- Alibaba Cloud is not a direct supplier on the UK Digital Marketplace. Procurement would require a bespoke commercial route, adding 3-6 months and significant legal/procurement cost. | High | BR-007, NFR-C-004 | Only mitigation is Alibaba applying for G-Cloud 15 (deadline passed Jan 2026). Bespoke procurement is theoretically possible but impractical for this programme timeline. |
| 2 | **No NCSC Cloud Security Principles assessment** -- Information assurance teams cannot complete the standard cloud risk assessment without an NCSC evaluation. This blocks SIRO sign-off. | High | BR-007, NFR-C-005, NFR-SEC-001-005 | Commission independent NCSC-style assessment (GBP 50K-100K, 3-6 months). This creates an unacceptable schedule risk given the May 2026 enforcement deadline. |
| 3 | **National security concerns** -- Alibaba Group is headquartered in Hangzhou, China. China's National Intelligence Law (2017) mandates cooperation with government intelligence requests. The UK's National Security and Investment Act 2021 may require review. | High | NFR-C-001 (UK GDPR), NFR-SEC-003, BR-007 | No practical mitigation. Legal review required, but the political and reputational risk of hosting a UK Government citizen-facing service on Chinese-owned infrastructure is significant regardless of technical safeguards. |
| 4 | **No Cyber Essentials certification** -- Mandatory for UK Government suppliers handling citizen data. | High | BR-007, NFR-C-005, NFR-SEC-005 | Alibaba Cloud would need to obtain certification. Timeline and willingness unknown. |
| 5 | **Limited service catalogue in London** -- Many PaaS and analytics services (AnalyticDB, MaxCompute, DataWorks, Quick BI, EventBridge, PolarDB) are unavailable in the London region. | Medium | FR-006, FR-007, FR-011, NFR-P-002 | Use self-managed open-source alternatives (Kafka, Grafana, Apache Superset) or third-party SaaS. This increases operational burden and negates managed service benefits. |
| 6 | **No UK Government precedent** -- No known UK Government department or agency operates production workloads on Alibaba Cloud. Being the first carries significant risk. | High | All requirements | No mitigation. This is a pathfinder risk that cannot be offset. |
| 7 | **Thin UK partner/integrator ecosystem** -- Very few UK-based system integrators have Alibaba Cloud expertise, especially in government digital. Recruitment of Alibaba Cloud-skilled staff is difficult. | Medium | All delivery requirements | Engage Alibaba Cloud professional services directly, or train existing team. Both options add time and cost. |
| 8 | **CDN PoP density** -- Alibaba Cloud CDN has significantly fewer European/UK points of presence than AWS CloudFront, Azure CDN, or Cloudflare. | Low | NFR-P-001, BR-003 | Use third-party CDN (Cloudflare, Fastly) in front of Alibaba Cloud origin. Adds complexity and cost. |
| 9 | **Management plane data sovereignty** -- Even with data at rest in London, management plane operations (console access, API calls, billing) may route through Alibaba's global infrastructure including Chinese-based systems. | High | NFR-C-001, NFR-SEC-003 | Requires detailed legal and technical analysis of data flows. No simple mitigation exists. |
| 10 | **Cross-region DR limited to Frankfurt** -- The London region has only 2 AZs. Cross-region DR requires Frankfurt (Germany), placing backup data outside UK jurisdiction. | Medium | NFR-A-002 | Accept cross-AZ DR within London (2 AZs). Cross-region DR would violate UK data residency requirement. Acceptable for non-PII data but problematic for the full dataset. |

---

## Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Rationale | Priority |
|---|---------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | **Do not select Alibaba Cloud** for the UK Fuel Price Transparency Service | Four critical compliance failures (G-Cloud, NCSC, Cyber Essentials, OFFICIAL classification support) create insurmountable barriers within the programme timeline. National security concerns add political and reputational risk. No UK Government precedent means pathfinder risk. The May 2026 enforcement deadline leaves no time for remediation. | High |
| 2 | **Select AWS (eu-west-2), Azure (UK South/West), or Google Cloud (europe-west2)** as primary cloud platform | All three are G-Cloud listed, NCSC assessed, Cyber Essentials Plus certified, have deep UK Government customer bases, and offer comprehensive service catalogues in UK regions. The technology risk is orders of magnitude lower. | High |
| 3 | **Document this evaluation as evidence for TCoP compliance** | TCoP requires evaluation of hosting options. This assessment demonstrates due diligence in evaluating a broader market, including non-traditional cloud providers, even when the conclusion is to select an established provider. | Medium |
| 4 | **Monitor Alibaba Cloud's UK Government readiness** for future phases | If Alibaba Cloud obtains G-Cloud listing, NCSC assessment, and Cyber Essentials in future, re-evaluate for non-critical workloads (e.g., analytics, development environments) where price competitiveness (10-30% cheaper) could deliver value. | Low |
| 5 | **Ensure procurement documentation records the rationale** for excluding Alibaba Cloud | Transparent decision-making supports audit trail, NAO/PAC scrutiny, and any future challenges from Alibaba Cloud or their partners. Record specific compliance gaps, not general vendor preference. | Medium |
