## Project Overview

This is an ArcKit-governed architecture project for a **UK Government Fuel Price Transparency Service** that consumes petrol and diesel price data from the CMA Fuel Finder open data scheme.

### Domain Context

The **Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)** established the Fuel Finder open data scheme under the **Motor Fuel Price (Open Data) Regulations 2025**. Fuel retailers must publish real-time pricing data. This service consumes, aggregates, and presents that data to citizens and government policy teams.

**Key reference**: [Fuel Finder Enforcement Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fuel-finder-enforcement-guidance)

### Service Scope

- Ingest real-time fuel price data from the Fuel Finder open data API
- Aggregate prices by region, retailer, and fuel type (petrol, diesel, super unleaded)
- Provide a public-facing price comparison tool for citizens
- Generate analytics dashboards for CMA enforcement and DESNZ policy teams
- Monitor retailer compliance with data publication requirements
- Publish open data feeds for third-party consumers

### Key Stakeholders

- **Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)** - Scheme owner, enforcement
- **Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ)** - Fuel market policy
- **Citizens / Motorists** - End users seeking cheapest fuel
- **Fuel Retailers** - Data providers under regulation
- **GDS** - Service Standard compliance
- **CDDO** - Technology Code of Practice compliance

### Regulatory & Compliance Requirements

- Motor Fuel Price (Open Data) Regulations 2025
- CMA Fuel Finder Enforcement Guidance
- UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018
- GDS Service Standard (14 points)
- Technology Code of Practice (13 points)
- NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework / Secure by Design
- HM Treasury Green Book (for business case)
- HM Treasury Orange Book (for risk management)

## Technical Context

When generating artifacts for this project, consider:

- **Data Source**: CMA Fuel Finder open data API (real-time fuel prices from UK retailers)
- **Data Volume**: ~8,500 fuel stations across the UK, updated multiple times daily
- **Hosting**: UK Government cloud (likely AWS GovCloud or Azure UK regions)
- **Users**: Citizens (public), CMA analysts, DESNZ policy teams
- **Integration**: GOV.UK frontend, open data publishing, analytics platforms
- **Security Classification**: OFFICIAL (fuel price data is not sensitive)
