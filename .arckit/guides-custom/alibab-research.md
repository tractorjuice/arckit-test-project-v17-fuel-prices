> **Guide Origin**: Community | **Generated By**: `/arckit.template-builder` | **ArcKit Version**: 3.0.4

`/arckit.community.alibab-research` generates a technical research document evaluating Alibaba Cloud services against project requirements, with UK Government compliance checks.

## Preparation

| Artefact | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Requirements (`ARC-*-REQ-*.md`) | Services are evaluated against these requirements — the research is only as good as the requirements it maps to |
| Architecture Principles (`ARC-000-PRIN-*.md`) | Principles guide service selection criteria (e.g., prefer open standards, UK data residency) |

---

## Usage

```text
/arckit.community.alibab-research 001

Output: `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ALRS-v1.0.md`
